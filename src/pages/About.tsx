          👋 Hi, I’m Misbakhul Kharis — a <strong>Full Stack Developer with 6+ years of
          experience</strong> building clean, scalable, and high-performance web
          applications. I specialize in <strong>React JS, Next JS, TypeScript, Node JS, Laravel, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, TailwindCSS </strong>and I’m passionate about clean code, performance, and
          solving real-world problems through tech. <br /><br />
          
          🚀 My journey started during university through internships and freelance projects. Since then,
          I’ve worked with organizations like <strong>KUD Minatani</strong>, where I
          digitized business operations, and <strong>PT. Infomedia Nusantara</strong>, where I
          honed my skills in modern web development and collaborative workflows. 
          While working at PT. Infomedia Nusantara, I continued honing my skills not only through professional collaboration but also by freelancing. 
          After my time at Infomedia, I expanded my freelance work for <strong>Belanja Mobil Auction</strong> and <strong>Dibilabs.id</strong>, delivering impactful, production-ready solutions.<br /><br />

          🔍 I'm actively <strong>open to remote opportunities (freelance or full-time) </strong>
          where I can contribute to impactful products while continuing to grow
          as a developer. <br /><br />

          👇 Feel free to check out my work, explore my resume, or reach out—I’d love to hear from you!
